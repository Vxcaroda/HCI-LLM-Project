Q1) write a python program that does auto text completion. do not use any packages that do not work on windows, and make it run in terminal for simplicity

A1) Auto text completion can be a complex task, and building a sophisticated model from scratch is beyond the scope of this answer. However, I can provide 
    a simple example using a prefix tree (Trie) data structure to demonstrate the basic idea. A Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic 
    set of strings, where each node in the tree represents a single character. This makes it a good fit for building a basic auto text completion system.
    Here's a simple Python program that demonstrates auto text completion using a Trie:

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return []
            node = node.children[char]
        return self._collect_all_words(node, prefix)

    def _collect_all_words(self, node, prefix):
        words = []
        if node.is_end_of_word:
            words.append(prefix)
        for char, child in node.children.items():
            words += self._collect_all_words(child, prefix + char)
        return words

def main():
    trie = Trie()
    words = ["apple", "app", "banana", "bat", "batman", "car", "carbon", "cargo"]
    for word in words:
        trie.insert(word)

    while True:
        prefix = input("Enter prefix: ")
        if prefix == "exit":
            break
        completions = trie.search(prefix)
        print("Completions:", completions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

    This program creates a simple Trie and inserts some example words. The user can then input a prefix, and the program will return a list of possible completions. 
    To exit the program, type "exit". Note that this example is case-sensitive and doesn't handle special characters or punctuation. You can customize the code to 
    improve its functionality and handle more complex scenarios.

Q2) where can I find a useful collection of words to use. in other words I want a large dictionary of words to use in this program

A2) A popular source for a large collection of words is the word list from the SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) project, which is used by various open-source 
    spell checking libraries. The largest word list from this project is available for download from the following link:
    wordlist.7z (15.8 MB)
    After downloading the file, you will need to extract its content, which is a plain text file named wordlist.txt. Each line in the file represents a single word. 
    To load this list of words into your Python program, you can use the following function:

def load_words_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        words = [line.strip() for line in file]
    return words

To use this function in your main program, simply call it and pass the file path of your wordlist.txt file:

def main():
    trie = Trie()
    words = load_words_from_file("wordlist.txt")
    for word in words:
        trie.insert(word)

    while True:
        prefix = input("Enter prefix: ")
        if prefix == "exit":
            break
        completions = trie.search(prefix)
        print("Completions:", completions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This will load the words from the file and insert them into your Trie, providing a much larger dictionary of words for your auto text completion program.

Q3) great. everything is working. next, write a python program that does auto word correction. do not use any packages that do not work on windows, 
    and make it run in terminal for simplicity. it should be a brand new file, not integrated in the last program. 

A2) Here's a simple Python program that demonstrates auto text correction using a Trie and the Levenshtein distance to find the best corrections:

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word, max_edit_distance=2):
        current_row = range(len(word) + 1)
        corrections = []

        for char, child in self.root.children.items():
            self._recursive_search(child, char, word, current_row, corrections, max_edit_distance)

        return corrections

    def _recursive_search(self, node, word_so_far, word, prev_row, corrections, max_edit_distance):
        columns = len(word) + 1
        current_row = [prev_row[0] + 1]

        for column in range(1, columns):
            insert_cost = current_row[-1] + 1
            delete_cost = prev_row[column] + 1
            replace_cost = prev_row[column - 1] + (word_so_far[-1] != word[column - 1])
            current_row.append(min(insert_cost, delete_cost, replace_cost))

        if current_row[-1] <= max_edit_distance and node.is_end_of_word:
            corrections.append((current_row[-1], word_so_far))

        if min(current_row) <= max_edit_distance:
            for letter, child in node.children.items():
                self._recursive_search(child, word_so_far + letter, word, current_row, corrections, max_edit_distance)

def load_words_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        words = [line.strip() for line in file]
    return words

def main():
    trie = Trie()
    words = load_words_from_file("HCI-LLM-Project\HCI_LLM\dictionary.txt")
    for word in words:
        trie.insert(word)

    while True:
        input_word = input("Enter a word: ")
        if input_word == "exit":
            break
        corrections = trie.search(input_word)
        if corrections:
            sorted_corrections = sorted(corrections, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
            print("Corrections:", [correction[1] for correction in sorted_corrections])
        else:
            print("No corrections found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
